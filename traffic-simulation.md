## üö¶ **Project Title: Multithreaded Traffic Simulation**

### üß† **Idea**

Simulate a simple traffic system with different types of vehicles (`Car`, `Truck`, `Motorbike`) that move across an intersection. Each vehicle is a thread that:

* Approaches an intersection
* Requests to enter (with proper mutex locking to avoid collisions)
* Waits if needed (simulate stop signs or traffic lights)
* Exits the intersection

You‚Äôll implement:

* Inheritance: Base `Vehicle` class with derived classes like `Car`, `Truck`, etc.
* Multithreading: Each vehicle is its own thread.
* Mutex: Protect shared intersection resources (e.g., so only one vehicle crosses at a time or in allowed patterns).
* Class design: Manager, simulation controller, and vehicle hierarchy.

## üß± **Main Components**

### 1. `Vehicle` (Base Class)

```cpp
class Vehicle {
protected:
    std::string id;
    int speed;
public:
    virtual void approachIntersection() = 0;
    virtual void crossIntersection() = 0;
    virtual ~Vehicle() {}
};
```

### 2. Derived Classes

```cpp
class Car : public Vehicle { ... };
class Truck : public Vehicle { ... };
class Motorbike : public Vehicle { ... };
```

Each class can override `approachIntersection()` and `crossIntersection()` with slight behavior differences (e.g., slower crossing for `Truck`, random delays for `Motorbike`).

### 3. `IntersectionController`

* Manages the intersection logic.
* Holds a `std::mutex` to control access.
* Optional: simulate a 4-way stop or round-robin scheduler.

```cpp
class IntersectionController {
    std::mutex intersection_mutex;
public:
    void requestToCross(Vehicle* v);
};
```

### 4. `SimulationManager`

* Spawns multiple vehicle threads randomly (or based on input).
* Controls simulation time and exit conditions.

## üîÑ **Simulation Flow**

1. `SimulationManager` spawns `N` threads, each representing a random vehicle type.
2. Each `Vehicle` thread:

   * Approaches the intersection (print/logging)
   * Requests access from `IntersectionController` (mutex)
   * Crosses (simulate with `sleep_for`)
   * Exits
3. Optional: Maintain a log of entries/exits for analysis or replay.

---

## ‚ú® **Optional Features**

* Add traffic lights or stop signs (state machine).
* Prioritize emergency vehicles.
* Record metrics like average wait time, throughput.
* Visualize with simple ASCII art or output logs.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Tools & Techniques**

* **C++17 or later**
* `std::thread`, `std::mutex`, `std::lock_guard`
* `std::shared_ptr`
* `std::chrono` for timing and sleep simulation
* Inheritance and polymorphism

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Estimated Effort**

* **Day 1:**

  * Design base and derived classes for vehicles.
  * Implement `IntersectionController` with mutex protection.
  * Write a test to spawn 5‚Äì10 vehicles.
* **Day 2:**

  * Add logic for simulating time, traffic rules.
  * Add optional logging, performance metrics.

---

## ‚úÖ **Success Criteria**

* Multiple vehicle types cross the intersection without collisions.
* Mutex protects shared access.
* Code uses base/derived classes effectively.
* Simulation results are printed clearly or logged.
